# Non-convex Optimization With Contraction Map


The strong contraction mapping, a self-mapping that the range is always a subset of the domain, admits a unique fixed-point which can be pinned down by the iteration of the mapping. As an application of strong contraction mapping, we design a topological non-convex optimization method to achieve global minimum convergence. The strength of the approach is its robustness to local minima and initial point position.
